# Algorithms @ Seoul National University, Fall 2015

In the class, you learn organized and effective thinking methods for probem solving. You learn inductive and recursive ways of thinking through diverse topics. Among others, included in the class are analysis tools (asymptotic complexity, recurrence), sorting and selection, retrieval and insertion of data (search tree, hash table), dealing with sets, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, text pattern matching, limit of computation (NP-Completeness), problem space, etc.
