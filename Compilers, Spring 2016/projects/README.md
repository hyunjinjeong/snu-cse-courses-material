# A Compiler for the SnuPL/1 Language

The course project was to implement a simple compiler for the SnuPL/1 language from scratch. It compiles the SnuPL/1 language to 32-bit Intel assembly code or an executable binary file.

The complete source code of compiler is in [5.Code.Generation/snuplc/src](https://github.com/hyunjinjeong/snu-cse-courses-material/tree/master/Compilers%2C%20Spring%202016/projects/5.Code.Generation/snuplc/src) and the sample files are in [samples](https://github.com/hyunjinjeong/snu-cse-courses-material/tree/master/Compilers%2C%20Spring%202016/projects/samples).

You can use a SnuPL/1 syntax highlighter for vim. Check this repository: https://github.com/hyunjin95/snupl-syntax-highlighter

## Projects

There were five projects we had to complete during the semester. A detailed explanation of each project is given in the project pdf files in the project directory.

### 1. Scanning

In the first phase, my job was to implement a scanner for the SnuPL/1 language as specified in the course project overview.

### 2. Parsing

In the second phase of our semester project, we constructed a parser for the SnuPL/1 language based on a hand-written predictive parser.

### 3. Semantic Analysis

In the third phase of the project, my job was to perform semantic analysis. In other words, I had to do type checking.

### 4. Intermediate Code Generation

In this phase, my task was to convert the abstract syntax tree into our intermediate representation in the three-address code form.

### 5. Code Generation

In the fifth and last phase of the project, my task was to convert the IR code into x86 assembly code.

After finishing all these phases, the SnuPL/1 compiler was completed: it takes programs written in SnuPL/1 and outputs assembly code that can be compiled by an assembler into an executable file.
