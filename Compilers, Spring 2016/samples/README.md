# Sample Files

The files in this folder are sample files for SnuPL/1.

## Run the compiler

To run the compiler, run the following:
```
./snuplc fibo.mod
```
This will produce an assembly file as an output. 'fibo.mod.s' will be generated by this command. or you can put:
```
./snuplc --exe fibo.mod
```
This will make an executable file. For more information, run this:
```
./snuplc --help
```

## Execute the sample file
'fibo.mod' takes an input and prints its Fibonacci number as long as the input is valid, which means a number greater than 0. 'fibo' is an executable binary file that has been already compiled. To test the file:
```
./fibo
```
