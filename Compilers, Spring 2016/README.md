# Compilers @ Seoul National University, Spring 2016

This course covers compiler construction, i.e., theory and practice of programming language translation. Topics covered include lexical scanning, parsing, syntactic and semantic analysis, compile-time error handling, runtime environments, and code generation.
We will build a simple, but fully functional compiler from scratch during the semester. Building the compiler requires a significant effort; as a consequence the grade for this class will be based to 2/3 on the semester project.
