# Database @ Seoul National University, Spring 2020

This is an introductory database course where we will cover the basic topics of database technology, including data models, query languages, integrity constraints, database design, storage structures, and transaction processing. Students are expected to have sufficient programming skills since there will be two term projects with substantial programming involved. Prerequisites are data structures.

Lectures will be conducted in a ‘flipped learning’ manner. Students are required to watch the relevant video lectures before coming to class. Checkup quizzes will be given at the beginning of each class.
